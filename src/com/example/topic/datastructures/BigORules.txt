BIG O Rule Book

Rule 1 - Worst case.
         Always consider worst case scenario while computing Big O notations.

Rule 2 - Remove constants
         Ignore/Removes calculated constants while computing Big O, since with large data sets
         the n value becomes large and constants become negligible.

Rule 3 - Different terms for inputs
         For different types of inputs for the same function/method the Big O calculation should be different.
         For the same method if the execution inside the method has nested loop, then the n value is multiplied,
         where in case of sequential loops the n value is added.

Rule 4 - Drop non dominants
         While calculating Big O, drop off the values that don't matter much when extreme data set is considered.
